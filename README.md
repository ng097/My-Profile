**Background Information:** 

I am of Greek decent but born in Australia, turning 25 years old this year with 3 years’ experience in the IT world. I attended St Spyridon College from Kindergarten to year 12 finishing in 2015, completely my Higher School Certificate. As St Spyridon is a Greek school it allowed me to learn how to speak Greek which helped in communicating with my Grandparents. As most my Hobby is playing Computer games with my friends during my spare time. I also have a great interest in building Computers which led to all my friends coming to me for help. I am a big admirer of the Premier League and support Liverpool FC. Soccer was a great hobby of mine when I was younger and an interesting fact that other may find interesting is that once I scored 14 goals in a single football game. 

Interest in IT

My interest in IT started at a young age due to my interest in PC games. The idea of coding and being able to write in code also intrigue me and it has been something I’ve wanted to learn for a long time. My interest in the IT industry started to get more serious as I progressed in high school looking at my older cousin for guidance. My cousin who is 5 years older than me sparked the interest of working for a big IT company one day. Many years later I find myself having 3 years’ experience under my belt having worked as a contractor for the likes of, Richemont,  Sydney International Airport and Opal Health Care to mention a few. 
I chose to come to RMIT as during my busy work schedule I needed to find a course that would provide me the flexibility I need to juggle both. I expect to learn all the basic knowledge required to continue performing my daily job at the highest level. I am expected to complete my course as part of my work agreement allowing me to further my knowledge in the wonderful world of IT.

The position I have chosen as my dream job is a Cyber Security & Compliance Manager. I have always loved the aspect of cyber security good and bad. As I grew older, I understood that business should consider cyber security as top priority. The aspect of someone stealing data or finding their way through a company’s firewall excites me but being able to prevent that outcome brings greater joy. 

Skills and qualifications

•	Tertiary qualification or significant equivalent experience.

•	High level of IT security regulation and standards knowledge. 

•	Success in affecting change in the adoption of ICT solutions in a multifaceted organisation

•	An ability and willingness to travel within NSW and support other operational roles during disasters, emergencies, and other events, consistent with skills, background, and personal circumstances.

Currently I have minimal skills and qualification in the cyber space. In saying that, I have worked closely to the Cyber Security team at Sydney International Airport where I have had experience working at. During this experience it greatly heightened my interest in cyber security and consolidated it to be my dream job in the future. The plan I have set out for myself in the coming years is to finish my degree and do my master’s in cyber security with will open the door for many working opportunities. I am currently working in the IT industry and have requested to my employer that any Cyber related tasks or jobs be given to me in order to learn and develop my skills and knowledge. This all with an engineer overlooking my work. 

Personal Profile

Results of Myers-Briggs Test 
I don’t seem to agree with all of these results. I feel like most of them are relevant, but I would not consider my self an introvert. Due to my experiences at work, I have been placed outside my comfort zone quite a lot. I have been required to speak to people in important position and was required to have a high level of customer interaction. 
Having a high assertive identity can have both a negative and positive impact in a team environment. I believe this assertiveness can positively impact in a team situation as many people require a team leader who will organise and make key decisions when needed.
I have worked in many teams previously and have always taken my personality attributes into consideration. I am aware of how to handle team situations and will prove to be a reliable asset to any team.
Results of online learning style test
 
This test result states that Kinaesthetic learning is my strong suit. I will 100% agree with this result as I do find myself learning the best when I get placed into situations where I am forced to do. I don’t believe that any of these results will affect team work as working in a team brings a variety of different people with different attributes together, therefore making how we all handle and use these attributes the more important aspect. 

Results of Big Five Personality Test
 
The test results show that I am average in most of the personality dimensions. I take that as I offer a bit of everything. My highest score is in Extraversions which relates to a person’s inclination to seek stimulation from the outside world. I believe this being my strongest score will benefit a team environment as it brings me great joy from achievements. This being said I will want to achieve outcome from the group task which will drive myself to perform at my best and give it my all. 
Project Idea


**Overview**

During my time in the IT industry, I have worked with numerous organisations which allowed me to be part of there IT Service Desk.  My project idea of a fully automated IT Service Desk would improve end-user experience, user productivity, minimize user downtime and increase the time spent on high priority issues. The Help Desk software will automatically assess the user’s issue, while assigning the issue to the specified user. From past experience most day to day issues end user’s face require a minimum of 5 minutes to troubleshoot and another couple of minutes to resolve, requiring little technical knowledge. By implementing a software which holds knowledge base documents of reoccurring issues, this could be easily automated. 


**Motivation**

The Motivation for this Project derives from my prior real-life experiences. Being able to see the ins and outs of how various companies operate their IT support in addition to how important and essential IT support is for the majority of companies. It is stated that the biggest obstacle for delivering high-quality help desk services is modernizing service systems, which is what my project will deliver. This project is quite interesting due to the amount of time and effort companies put in making an efficient and effective on-site IT support team. It is said that on average and depending on the company size, there is 1 IT staff for 75 users. Automating the support process will allow for more time on projects and depending on company size this ratio could even be reduced. 


**Description / Tools and Technologies**

The automatic help desk involves a lot of data collection prior to the software being effective. The idea starts with creating simple, easy to follow documentation of reoccurring issues that users are facing. The software will hold these documents as a knowledge base. It will need to be linked to the environment of the company whether their environment is based on-premises (e.g., Active Directory) or cloud (e.g., Office 365).
The software will be simple and user friendly with limited navigation and straight forward questions. The questions will be as followed:

•	Name – This is to help identify whether the user is considered a VIP user

•	Application that has the issue or whether it is just a general PC/hardware issue ?

•	Is the issue affecting BAU work for the user ?

•	How often are you experiencing the issue ?

•	Are you aware of this issue affecting other users ?

•	Brief description of the issue ?


These are just examples of questions that can be asked in order for the software to link the issue to the relevant documentation. Depending on the issue, the documentation will then be emailed to the user which they can then follow the instructions on how to fix the problem. If the issue is related to hardware the series of questions will change to more common hardware related issues. The system will identify whether or not it is adequate for the user to be given a new device or not. If the user is considered as VIP which will be determined based off their role in the business, the software will show a calendar where they can book the next available time with a technician to provide them with instantaneous assistance.  

As companies use many different devices for their employees the software will be compatible with all Operating Systems as well as in a form of an app. The app will be identical to the desktop software which will provide remote help as working remotely has grown due to the pandemic. If a hardware swap will be needed for a remote user, this information will be reported back to the on-site technician who can pre-configure and post a new device out. 
All that will be needed on-site is a computer or an iPad running the software where users are able at anytime to use and lodge an issue. A technician or service desk manager will be responsible for overlooking the software which has a management portal allowing an insight on what has been lodge and what has been scheduled. This will allow for the manager to make sure the software is providing the service it is meant too and not giving wrong documentation to the issues reported by the users. Allowing adequate time in technicians schedules to offer support to VIP users and any hardware related issues together with allowing more time for projects and high priority matters.


**Skills Required** 

The software will require basic IT help desk experience. This involves communication with customers as well as organisational skills. It will require team communication and a level understand of common Application/ Hardware issues. Due to the compatibility of the software no special hardware will be required to run the software which will enable any business to use it at any stage. Writing the software will require a software engineer as well as developers to code the software. It will need an overall project manager to ensure the software stays user friendly and basic. Like any software development the project is highly feasible, and the skills required in creating the software are not hard to come by. 


**Outcome**

If the product is successful, the organisation can use it to achieve continuous improvements to end-to-end services. The focus of the software is to improve efficiency while delivering quality services which align with customer needs. The Software will help define its IT service and due to its customisation, implementation and improvements can be made in stages. Every large organisation requires on-site IT support, the software will allow for single interaction resolutions as well as provide a seamless experience for end users.
